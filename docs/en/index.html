      <p>
        Despite all, why do we still teach technology? With so many platforms, bootcamps, prompts, solutions and trends constantly come and go, it is hard to recall a time before education became a part of the waves. Nonetheless, many new media artists teach technology to nurture themselves and share the joy of learning, imagining, and “spinning” new line of pedagogy. However, even in new media artists, teaching practices are frequently considered something supplementary to art practices, often ending up transient and forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this call, we look forward to archive such teaching practices in new media art. It is a continuation of the previous project <Perpetual Teaching Across Temporary Places>, an interview study about conditions, motivations, and practices of teaching computing classes and workshops in new media art, based on conversations with 18 artist-educators across three continents. For the next chapter, we wish to focus on archiving artifacts developed by new media artists for teaching computing and digital media, as a part of community projects, technical investigations, or pedagogical experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are teaching, or taught computing/digital media classes or community/public workshops, please consider submitting to our public archive project <Inviting Sequences>. We welcome a piece of syllabus, proposal, or manifesto you have written in the past. Sketches, images, or teaching materials generated during the workshop preparation process are also great. Small communal gatherings, festivals, jokes, records of survival and conflicts are also welcomed. We look forward to meet and learn from each other.
